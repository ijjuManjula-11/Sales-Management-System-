# Sales-Management-System (SQL)
Developed a Sales Management System using SQL to efficiently manage and track sales transactions, customer information, and product details.

The system enabled operations such as recording sales, updating product inventories, generating sales reports, and analyzing customer purchase patterns. 

By designing structured queries and implementing relational database concepts, I ensured data integrity, consistency, and quick retrieval of insights. 

This project provided hands-on experience in database design, SQL querying, and managing real-world transactional data, enhancing my understanding of practical business operations.
